# OptimumEmoji

Solution to a Common problem that nobody asked for.

If you are anything like me and have wanted to spam someone with a 100 emojis long text then you might have had the same question, what is the optimal ratio of copying, pasting and typing to result in the maximum number of emojis (subject to a constraint) with the least number of clicks.

Still don't get the problem? Try sending someone a 100 emojis. :)
